                  Hello! This is the first time that I have ever created a static web page from HTML and CSS and I am very excited to start this class. During the day, I am a product manager at Cvent where we work with products across IOS, Android, and the web. I hope to take what I learn in this class and apply it to my career.
                </p>

                  I grew up in Scotch Plains, New Jersey and graduated from the University of Maryland in 2013 with a degree in Information Systems and Finance. Since graduating, I have had a position with the Super Bowl Host Committee and my current role at Cvent where I began as a product analyst and now hold the Product Lead title.
